# Concordance
A C program that takes as input a sufficiently large text document (several are available online for testing; e.g. via Project Gutenberg), and produces as output (via stdout) an alphabetical listing of each unique word in the document (case insensitive and space separated, though be careful to consider hyphenated words), along with the lines from the input document that the word appears on.
